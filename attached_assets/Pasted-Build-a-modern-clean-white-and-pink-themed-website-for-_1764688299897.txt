Build a modern, clean, white-and-pink themed website for a psychologist named Himanshi. The design vibe should feel warm, soft, and comforting, with rounded cards, pastel gradients, and minimal clutter. The site should be fully responsive.
Pages / Sections Needed:
1. Hero Section
Photo placeholder for Himanshi (IG handle: @therapy.w.himanshi — pull inspiration for styling and tone, but do NOT scrape posts directly; just mirror her aesthetic: soft pinks, minimal text, calming vibes).
Headline: “Therapy with Himanshi”
Subheadline: “A safe space for healing, growth, and emotional clarity.”
CTA buttons:
Book a Session (opens Cal.com booking widget)
Contact Me (scrolls to form)
2. About Section
Brief intro about her work as a psychologist.
Clean two-column layout: image + text.
Soft pink gradient background.
(Use placeholder text but structure it so we can later swap with real bio.)
3. Services Section
Create styled service cards such as:
One-on-One Therapy
Anxiety & Stress Counseling
Relationship Counseling
Teen/Young Adult Therapy
Online Sessions Available
Each card should have:
Icon
Short description
“Book Now” button → opens Cal.com
4. Booking Integration
Embed Cal.com for appointments.
Include a dedicated page /book that contains the full Cal.com embed.
All “Book Now” buttons should link here.
5. Payment Integration
Add Razorpay Checkout integration.
Create a /payment page with:
Session fee placeholder
Razorpay payment button
On success → redirect to Cal.com booking
On failure → show an inline error
Make the Razorpay integration modular so we can plug in keys easily.
6. Contact / Reach-out Form
Name
Email
Phone
Message
Store responses in a simple backend (Node/Express or Python FastAPI).
Add email notifications (use Replit email or any SMTP).
Soft pink accent, floating labels, success animation.
7. Footer
Instagram link: @therapy.w.himanshi
Email placeholder
Cal.com booking link
Soft pink minimal footer bar
Extra Requirements
Use HTML + CSS + JS or a lightweight framework like Next.js.
Keep color palette: #ffffff, #ffc7df, #ff8eb3 (adjust as needed).
Modern animations (fade-up, smooth transitions).
Clean typography: Inter, Poppins, or similar.
